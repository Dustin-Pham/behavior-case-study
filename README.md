**Problem:** 
Find any information from consumer behavior dataset in order to promote more sales. Try to find any information specifically consumers that view multiple pages and present findings and recommendations.

**Findings:** 
Firstly, I wanted to look at data on people that looked at multiple pages. My reason behind this is that without any other information any varaibles we can look at what the data presents us on people that spend their time scrolling through the Amazon page. We find that a large amount of users are Female, and that the dominant age group is 25-54. Knowing that reviews are important to a product being successful or not, we see that female left the most reviews. The reason for not having any comments on others, prefer not to say is because the variable is too unknown. Theres too many factors that come into play and its harder to generalize them because they are unique. The reason why I left them in is because if they happen to make up a good portion of the data, then we could shift our focus on them. 

**Recommendation:** 
From the findings, I believe that we should focus the advertisments towards females from ages 25-54. By doing so, we are (supposedly) catering towards over a little half of the users. In addition, we should focus on customer service responsiveness in order to achieve 100% satisfaction from the customers. Amazon could attempt to slightly change the system of the current customer service by increasing more employees in order to reduce the wait of the customers, or add more FAQs that could help those who need it.

**Conclusion:** This case study shows how a I can help a company solve a complex problem and achieve its business goals. My skills in problem-solving and analysis is essential in debunking ambiguous questions. In a case where theres another ambiguous question, I can break it down in a logical and structual analysis in order to develop a business decision.
