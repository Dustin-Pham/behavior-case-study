# Consumer Purchase Behavior Case Study

**Background:**
Amazon dataset that revolves around the consumers behavior. The goal is to analyze the data given and showcase my SQL, Power BI, and Python skills. Come up with real business questions and identify possible strategies in order to drive sales. I hope yall enjoy, and any feedback on anything would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

**Problem:** 
Find any information from consumer behavior dataset in order to promote more sales. Try to find any information specifically consumers that view multiple pages and present findings and recommendations.

**Findings:** 
Firstly, I wanted to look at data on people that looked at multiple pages. My reason behind this is that without any other information any varaibles we can look at what the data presents us on people that spend their time scrolling through the Amazon page. We find that a large amount of users are Female, and that the dominant age group is 25-54. Knowing that reviews are important to a product being successful or not, we see that female left the most reviews. The reason for not having any comments on others, prefer not to say is because the variable is too unknown. Theres too many factors that come into play and its harder to generalize them because they are unique. The reason why I left them in is because if they happen to make up a good portion of the data, then we could shift our focus on them. 

**Recommendation:** 
From the findings, I believe that we should focus the advertisments towards females from ages 25-54. By doing so, we are (supposedly) catering towards over a little half of the users. In addition, we should focus on customer service responsiveness in order to achieve 100% satisfaction from the customers. Amazon could attempt to slightly change the system of the current customer service by increasing more employees in order to reduce the wait of the customers, or add more FAQs that could help those who need it.

**Conclusion:** This case study shows how a I can help a company solve a complex problem and achieve its business goals. My skills in problem-solving and analysis is essential in debunking ambiguous questions. In a case where theres another ambiguous question, I can break it down in a logical and structual analysis in order to develop a business decision.

## Female Dashboard

**Problem:** 
Find any information on female from consumer behavior dataset. Develop recommendations in order to assist the business in driving sales.

**Findings:** 
It appears that females ages 16-24 is browsing amazon store the most and the purchase frequency for them is less than once a month. I also see that a large amount of female ages 25-54 purchases a few times a month when browsing a few times a month. Females age 25-54 would be the most helpful in driving more business since they leave the most reviews. When looking at the save for later and cart completion frequency, I mainly wanted to look at always cart completion or often since we are looking for higher chance of improving sales. I see that when people always complete cart completion, they  either sometimes save the item for later or often save the item for later. When looking at whether Personalized recommendation works, I was able to discover that it sometimes works, but for the most part, it never really works. 

**Recommendation:** 
Depends on the goals, I believe that for long term we should focus the advertisments towards females from ages 25-54. By doing so, we are building a crediable source for new audience to purchase new products. For short term, I believe that we should focus on females ages 16-24 because they are browsing a few times a month and from that have the larges purchase frequency of once a week, once a month, and less than once a month. We clearly need to fix the personalized recommendation, maybe if they opt-in to personalized ads, we would be able to get a better understanding of what they may want to purchase. 

**Conclusion:** This case study shows how a I can help a company solve a complex problem and achieve its business goals. My skills in problem-solving and analysis is essential in debunking ambiguous questions. I try to identify new target markets in order to drive more sales. In a case where theres another ambiguous question, I can break it down in a logical and structual analysis in order to develop a business decision.

## Male Dashboard

**Problem:** Find any information on male from consumer behavior dataset. Develop recommendations in order to assist the business in driving sales.

**Findings:** 
It appears that males ages 25-54 is the dominant user from the data. Male users are browsing amazon store the most and the purchase frequency for them dominant all the other age group. Male users also leaves the most reviews. It appears that for males, if one were to save for later often or rarely they are a higher chance of always having a cart completion. When looking at whether Personalized recommendation works, I was able to discover that it sometimes and often works. This means that we could focus personalized ads more.

**Recommendation:** With the evident results from the data, I believe that for both long term and short term we should focus the advertisments towards males from ages 25-54. By doing so, we could drive more revenue and create a credible company with all the reviews left. The personalized ads have slightly been working (can be improved). We can see that males are easier to observe and we could easily focus on a certain group. Focus on trying to get more reviews in, and increase the browsing frequency by promoting deals on lighting sales on personalized ads.

**Conclusion:** This case study shows how a I can help a company solve a complex problem and achieve its business goals. My skills in problem-solving and analysis is essential in debunking ambiguous questions. I try to identify new target markets in order to drive more sales. In a case where theres another ambiguous question, I can break it down in a logical and structual analysis in order to develop a business decision.
